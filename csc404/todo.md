# Things to Study
* NMAP
  * Read the free portions of NMAP Network Scanning online, then acquire the
book and read the non-free portions, then read through the changelog of things
that have changed since the book was published.
  * Find an environment in which to practice and experience the use of NMAP.
  * Plan how to efficiently and easily view the results of scans. Find some
way to parse the information into a spreadsheet, for instance, or some other
method of viewing the data. A database, perhaps, with an easily accessible
frontend? Do some research for possible solutions.

* Metasploit
  * Read through Metasploit Unleashed to both become familiar with the details
of Metasploit and to learn more about exploitation in general.
  * Acquire and read "Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide"

* Vulnerable VMs
  * Try to crack vulnerable VMs. Then Read through walkthroughs for said 
vulnerable VMs to get acquianted with the tools and the mindset to compromise
them.

* Markdown
  * Become familiar with markdown syntax and usage in order to make good
documentation efficiently.

* VIM
  * Practice more with VIM to get faster and more efficient with usage.

* Learning...
  * Use learncodethehardway.org to learn various languages/protocols
    * Specifically, check out the sections for UNIX (once released), C, and 
Python.
    * Working through Javascript could be helpful too.
